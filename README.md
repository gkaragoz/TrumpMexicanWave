#### Ride the Trump! follows U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump as he travels across the U.S. delivering a variety of speeches and talks at a variety of venues. 
#### Succinct and moving, Trump's words inspire the audience to start a rousing wave of the Waveâ„¢! Much to Mr. Trump's chagrin, however, certain stickler unpatriotic citizens are choosing to protest and refuse to leave their seats.
